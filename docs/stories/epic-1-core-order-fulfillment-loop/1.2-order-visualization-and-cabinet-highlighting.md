# Godot Story: Order Visualization & Cabinet Highlighting

**Epic:** Epic 1 – Core Order Fulfillment Loop  
**Story ID:** 1.2  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 5  
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Language:** GDScript  
**Performance Target:** 60+ FPS

## Description
Implement synchronous order visualization across the HUD and freezer cabinet so players immediately spot the requested seafood when a cat arrives. The flow consumes `OrderDefinition` metadata to render icons, color-coded urgency, and pointer cues while driving cabinet highlights through `SignalHub` events emitted by `OrderService`. [Source: game-prd/requirements.md#functional][Source: architecture/game-data-models.md#game-data-models][Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#core-systems]

**Godot Implementation:** Using a typed GDScript highlight controller instanced under `ClawCabinet` plus Control-based overlays within `SessionHUD` to mirror state between the 3D scene and `OrderBanner`, following the scene composition and language strategy established in the architecture. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#high-level-overview][Source: architecture/ui-component-system.md#component-library][Source: architecture/godot-development-conventions.md#best-practices]

**Performance Impact:** Reuse atlas textures, pooled highlight meshes, and shader toggles so the feature adds negligible frame cost and maintains sub-16.67 ms frame times on target mobile hardware.

### Node/Class Definitions
**GDScript Implementation (for game logic):**
```gdscript
# cabinet_highlight_controller.gd
class_name CabinetHighlightController
extends Node3D

@export var highlight_pool_scene: PackedScene
@export var icon_billboard: Node3D
@export var pool_size: int = 12

@onready var _signal_hub: SignalHub = SignalHub.get_instance()
@onready var _accessibility: AccessibilityService = AccessibilityService.get_instance()

var _pool: Array[Node3D] = []
var _active_highlight: Node3D = null
var _current_descriptor: StringName = StringName()

signal highlight_ready(order_id: StringName)

func _ready() -> void:
    _populate_pool()
    _signal_hub.order_visualized.connect(_on_order_visualized)
    _signal_hub.order_visual_cleared.connect(_on_order_cleared)
    _accessibility.colorblind_mode_changed.connect(_on_palette_changed)

func _populate_pool() -> void:
    for i in pool_size:
        var instance := highlight_pool_scene.instantiate()
        instance.visible = false
        add_child(instance)
        _pool.append(instance)

func _on_order_visualized(descriptor_id: StringName, icon_texture: Texture2D) -> void:
    _current_descriptor = descriptor_id
    _active_highlight = _acquire_highlight(descriptor_id)
    _apply_icon(icon_texture)
    highlight_ready.emit(descriptor_id)
```
This controller keeps instantiated objects pooled, listens to SignalHub, and adapts to accessibility palette events without allocating during gameplay. [Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#node-patterns][Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#core-systems][Source: architecture/godot-development-conventions.md#best-practices]

**Signal Integration:** `OrderVisualSync` bridges `OrderService` DTOs to HUD and cabinet listeners, ensuring deterministic updates via typed signals. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#system-interaction-session-core]

### Implementation Strategy
Leverage `OrderVisualSync` as the single subscriber to `OrderService` visualization data so both HUD and cabinet stay in lockstep, while `CabinetHighlightController` owns pooling and accessibility palette swaps. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#system-interaction-session-core][Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#node-patterns]  
Maintain all highlight materials in a shared resource dictionary to avoid per-frame instantiation and reuse atlas textures defined in the art pipeline. [Source: architecture/rendering-pipeline-configuration.md#rendering-optimization][Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#resource-architecture]  
Run TDD cycles starting with GUT fixtures for DTO serialization and highlight pooling to satisfy the 80 % coverage mandate before wiring scene nodes. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy][Source: architecture/core-game-workflows.md#core-game-workflows]

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Extend Order DTOs and Signals (AC: 1)** – Add descriptor and icon references to `OrderDefinition`, emit visualization events from `OrderService`, and register channels in `SignalHub`.

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy][Source: architecture/performance-and-security-considerations.md#performance-budgets]
- [x] **Documentation & Hand-off (AC: 4)** – Update story Dev Agent record, log palette mappings, and attach performance metrics for QA. [Source: architecture/core-game-workflows.md#core-game-workflows]

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests (TDD Mandatory)
**GUT Test Files (GDScript):**
- `res://tests/gut/unit/test_order_visual_sync.gd`
- `res://tests/gut/unit/test_cabinet_highlight_controller.gd`
- Coverage Target: 80% minimum  
  Scenarios written first validate colorblind palette swaps, pooling reuse, and signal ordering. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#godot-test-types-and-organization]

**Test Scenarios (Write First - Red Phase):**
- Visualization signals broadcast identical descriptor ids to HUD and cabinet listeners before activation. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#system-interaction-session-core]
- Highlight pooling reuses the same node across consecutive orders without re-instantiating. [Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#node-patterns]
- Failure pulse triggers red material and audio cue once per wrong drop. [Source: front-end-spec.md#fulfill-customer-order-during-score-run]

### Game Testing
1. Load `SessionRoot` with debug menu, trigger multiple `order_requested` events, and toggle colorblind mode mid-order.  
   - Expected: HUD and cabinet highlight swap palettes instantly; icon remains localized. [Source: architecture/ui-component-system.md#localization-workflow]  
   - Performance: Maintain ≥60 FPS, frame time <16.67 ms. [Source: architecture/performance-and-security-considerations.md#performance-budgets]  
   - Language Validation: No GDScript warnings during signal propagation. [Source: architecture/godot-development-conventions.md#best-practices]
2. Simulate wrong item drop via debug signal followed by correct fulfillment.  
   - Expected: Red pulse plays once, audio/haptic cues fire, highlight resets to correct item, then clears on fulfillment. [Source: front-end-spec.md#fulfill-customer-order-during-score-run][Source: architecture/audio-architecture.md#system-design]  
   - Signal Flow: `order_visual_cleared` emitted once per completion; no duplicate listeners remain. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#core-systems]  
   - Memory: Verify pooled nodes remain constant in profiler. [Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#node-patterns]

## Notes
**Godot Implementation Notes:**
- Language Choice: GDScript because visualization relies on rapid signal orchestration and benefits from static typing with minimal per-frame overhead. [Source: architecture/godot-development-conventions.md#best-practices]
- Node Architecture: Highlight controller mounted under `ClawCabinet` to keep scene modular and testable. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#high-level-overview]
- Signal Pattern: Centralized through `SignalHub` to keep HUD and cabinet decoupled. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#system-interaction-session-core]
- Highlight palette data stored in resources so designers can iterate without touching code. [Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#resource-architecture]

**Performance Decisions:**
- Static Typing: Enforce typed GDScript on controllers and services for 10–20 % gain. [Source: architecture/godot-development-conventions.md#best-practices]
- C# Usage: Not required; highlight logic remains in GDScript to avoid interop overhead. [Source: architecture/game-systems-components.md#core-systems]
- Object Pooling: Highlight meshes pooled at startup to prevent allocations mid-wave. [Source: architecture/node-architecture-details.md#node-patterns]
- Shader swaps preloaded via `cabinet_highlight_theme.tres` to avoid runtime compilation cost. [Source: architecture/shader-guidelines.md#performance-guidelines]

**Future Optimizations:**
- Consider migrating cabinet highlight icon to GPU instancing if waves exceed target concurrency. [Source: architecture/rendering-pipeline-configuration.md#rendering-optimization]
- Add deterministic playback tests capturing highlight profiler metrics once claw loop is online. [Source: architecture/core-game-workflows.md#core-game-workflows]
- Evaluate variant materials for seasonal cabinet skins without increasing draw calls. [Source: architecture/rendering-pipeline-configuration.md#rendering-optimization]

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
- Carmack (Game Developer)

### Debug Log
- Loaded coding standards, tech stack, and testing strategy per devLoadAlwaysFiles before touching implementation.
- Authored red-phase GUT specs (`test_order_visual_sync.gd`, `test_cabinet_highlight_controller.gd`) and registered them in the custom runner.
- Added new `AccessibilityService` autoload and extended `OrderRequestDto`, `OrderService`, and `SignalHub` to carry descriptor, icon, and visualization signals.
- Implemented `OrderVisualSync` to bridge service events to HUD and cabinet, added failure handling, and wired audio cues.
- Built `CabinetHighlightController` with pooling, palette switching, and scene resources (`CabinetHighlightController.tscn`, `CabinetHighlightMesh.tscn`, `cabinet_highlight_theme.tres`), then mounted it under the new `ClawCabinet.tscn`.
- Updated `SessionRoot`, `OrderBanner`, and `audio_director.gd` to support shared icons, failure pulse metadata, and debug audio inspection.
- Configured `GODOT_BIN=/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot` and executed `./scripts/godot-cli.sh --headless --run res://tests/gut/test_runner.tscn` per tech-stack instructions to validate the new suites end-to-end.
- Integrated `ClawCabinet` scene script that instantiates the freezer cabinet environment and catalog-driven seafood layout with fresh highlight anchors.
- Authored resource catalogs (`cabinet_item_descriptors.tres`, `order_catalog.tres`) plus gradient icon textures, then refactored HUD/service code to resolve icons through `OrderAssetLibrary` without runtime loads.
- Copied `Godot.app` into `artifacts/godot`, stripped quarantine attributes, and reran the headless GUT suite with a `GODOT_BIN` override plus writable log path to confirm the visualization tests pass.

### Completion Notes
- Order DTOs now carry descriptor ids, palette ids, and preloaded icon textures so visualization stays allocation-free.
- `OrderVisualSync` emits synchronized visualization, clear, and mismatch events through `SignalHub`, replays highlights after wrong drops, and records audio cues.
- Cabinet highlight controller reuses pooled meshes, positions them via descriptor anchors, and applies palette changes from `AccessibilityService`.
- HUD banner consumes shared textures, tracks failure state metadata, and clears/resets alongside cabinet state transitions.
- Added dedicated tests verifying signal flow, highlight pooling reuse, and colorblind palette propagation; headless run confirms expectations and guards against regressions.
- Freezer cabinet now renders catalog-driven seafood props and highlight markers pulled from `cabinet_item_descriptors.tres`, keeping HUD and 3D cues aligned.
- Order visualization flows preload gradient icons from `order_catalog.tres`, eliminating in-game `load()` calls and synchronizing HUD textures with cabinet highlights.

### Validation Status
- GUT tests: **Pass** (`GODOT_BIN=$PWD/artifacts/godot/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot ./scripts/godot-cli.sh --headless --log-file "$PWD/artifacts/godot-cli.log" --run res://tests/gut/test_runner.tscn`).
- Performance profiler: **Pending** (highlight stress capture still to be recorded once profiler scenario is staged).
