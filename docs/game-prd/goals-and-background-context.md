# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a charming 3D claw-machine-meets-restaurant experience where players embody a penguin chef serving feline patrons.
- Provide a session-based order fulfillment loop with gradually rising pressure so casual players can practice claw skills without steep skill spikes.
- Simulate believable claw machine physics inside the freezer cabinet to satisfy players seeking realistic UFO catcher gameplay at home or on the go.
- Establish a replayable score-chasing structure that tracks accuracy and timing while reinforcing service-speed mastery.
- Launch on iOS and Android with responsive touch-first controls while sustaining 60 FPS on mid-range mobile hardware.

## Background Context
Claw and Snackle is a casual restaurant management game that blends Overcooked-inspired customer flow with the tactile thrill of operating a claw machine. Players act as a penguin proprietor who must pull the requested seafood from a frozen claw cabinet before each cat patron loses patience. The freezer showcases visible fish and shellfish encased in ice blocks, turning every order into a skill-based claw challenge.

The game targets claw machine and UFO catcher enthusiasts who want a faithful physics-driven experience on mobile (iOS and Android) while still enjoying cozy restaurant vibes. No comparable 3D claw machine title currently exists, creating a clear differentiation opportunity. Success for the MVP is defined by delivering a polished vertical slice where players chase high scores across escalating difficulty, losing lives when orders expire.
